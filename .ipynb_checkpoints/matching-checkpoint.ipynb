    "#### The motivation for matching\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to answer the three following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are the linguistic features (e.g. higher politeness) found in messages leading up to a betrayal similar to the features found in lies?\n",
    "2. Are the linguistic features of lies similar to the features of perceived lies?\n",
    "3. How do the linguistic features of truths perceived as truth, truths perceived as lies, undetected lies, and detected lies differ?\n",
    "\n",
    "All three of these questions involve a population of messages. In each question, we will be comparing a set of features of these messages across several groups: 2 groups for questions 1 and 2, 4 groups for question 3. This observation allows us in what follows to identify a common pitfall as well as a common solution to it for all three questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first instinct might be to indiscriminately compare the groups of messages defined in each question. This would pose a problem to the validity of our answers, as any correlations we might infer would be in danger of being _spurious_ correlations.\n",
    "Take for instance the second question. Even though a message might be a lie and a perceived lie at the same time, we consider the groups of lies and perceived lies to be mutually exclusive: it is as if we had two messages with identical content, but where one is in the group of lies and the other in the group of perceived lies. In conventional terms, we might arbitrarily designate one of these groups as the control group and the other as the treatment group.\n",
    "Let's accept as a premise that how well the game is going for the sender of a message influences both whether the message is a lie (or a perceived lie) and the politeness of the message: if the game is going well for the sender, he is less likely to lie (no need) and messages are more polite (less stress), whereas if the game is going badly for the sender, he is more likely to lie and messages are less polite. What we are going to see in the data is that messages which are lies will be less polite: this would be a spurious correlation, as we know from the original paper that lying is in general associated with more politeness, not less (the authors hypothesize lying causes the sender to \"cover up his tracks\" by being more polite)! In fact, the increased politeness would be due to the state of the game, not which group the message belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "A causal map of this situation might look like this, where G denotes how well the game is going, L whether the message is a lie or not and P the politeness of the message:\n",
    "```\n",
    "----(G)----\n",
    "|         |\n",
    "|         |\n",
    "v         v\n",
    "(L)----->(P)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to see from this diagram that how well the game is going is a confounder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the dataset of the initial paper, \"Linguistic Harbingers of Betrayal\", as well as this one, coming from the paper \"It Takes Two to Lie: One to Lie, and One to Listen\" are what we could call \"found data\". The questions we are asking would hardly lend themselves to an analysis conducted in a so-called \"natural experiment\" paradigm, as we have just shown. Instead, we are conducting an observational study which forces us to account for confounders.\n",
    "\n",
    "To remediate the problem of confounding variables, we would ideally like to match the examined groups on their confounding variables, so that any effect would be due to the group membership. Unfortunately, finding a close match can prove hard in practice. To circumvent this, we can instead resort to propensity score matching (PSM). The propensity indicates the probability of an individual sample to be in the treatment group, given its covariates (although we only consider those covariates that might be confounders, in this case). PSM means matching every observation in the treatment group to an observation in the control group with a similar propensity, which more or less nullifies the causal relation between the confounder and the group membership, thus removing it as a confounder. The general process we will use for PSM is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick the dependent variable which defines group membership.\n",
    "2. Pick the observed covariates which we believe might be confounders.\n",
    "3. Fit a logistic regression with the confounders as inputs and the dependent variable as output to model the propensity score.\n",
    "4. Compute the propensity score for all messages.\n",
    "5. Check that the covariates (confounders) are balanced (i.e. have a similar distribution) across the groups within strata (which we will define here as propensity score bins).\n",
    "5. Perform the matching using caliper matching.\n",
    "6. Check that the covariates are balanced across the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caliper matching is a greedy form of bipartite matching (one control observation can be associated to only one treatment observation), where a match is accepted if the difference in propensity scores is below a certain threshold. Also note that we specify logistic regression in the above algorithm, but only because it tends to perform well: we could otherwise use another ML algorithm to compute the propensity score. It is important to note that PSM only accounts for observable confounder, **not** for latent (i.e. unobserved) variables. The general process we identified allows us to write a unique method for PSM."

    "#### Advanced matching\n",

    "Question 2 offers a typical setup for matching. However, question 1 and 3 both pose certain difficulties when it comes to matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "In question 3, we have not two but four groups! Our process will encur the following modifications. In step 1, we need to create a dependent variable of our own, which will take 4 values instead of 2. In step 3, we need to fit a _multinomial_ logistic regression instead of a simple logistic regression: it will output a probability (i.e. propensity score) for each of the four class labels. In step 6, the caliper will be applied to all four propensities, and we will be moving from a *bipartite* matching problem to a *multipartite* matching problem. Finally, in step 7, we will check the covariate balance across 4 groups instead of two."
